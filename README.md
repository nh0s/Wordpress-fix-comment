This plugin prevents unauthenticated users from impersonating registered WordPress users in the comment section. By default, WordPress allows anyone to leave a comment by simply entering a name and email address — which can be exploited to post comments under someone else's identity.

With this plugin activated, if an unauthenticated user tries to comment using a name or email address that matches an existing user account, the comment will be blocked and the user will be prompted to log in.

This adds a simple but effective layer of protection against comment impersonation and helps preserve trust and identity integrity on your site.

Key Features:
- Blocks comment impersonation using known usernames or email addresses.
- Lightweight and easy to install — no configuration needed.
- Does not affect logged-in users.
